## Introduction

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### What is Asteo?

It's storytelling! Asteo is a platform that helps you gain a better insight into art. All arts are forms of storytelling and humans are natural storytellers. In the past, people drew on cave walls. The stories were then passed down orally. Asteo helps you capture your art and share it with others via maps or posts.

### How do I use Asteo?

Asteo understands the stories of art as the magical interplay between an artist, the era that influenced him and his collection of works. To create new artworks, if you don't find your desired epoch, you should create it first, as well as the corresponding creator. It is also important to mark the gallery of the object, so that others can find your work later on maps.

### What are my benefits of Asteo?

Once you've created a work of art. You can easily view artworks from all over the world under Writers Discovery and filter them by era and artist. Under Analytics, you can also see which eras and galleries are most frequently represented or how many visitors have already been to different galleries. The posting section of galleries shows you how other users have perceived a gallery and how many visitors are currently there. What are you waiting for? It's time to make the world more colorful!

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
